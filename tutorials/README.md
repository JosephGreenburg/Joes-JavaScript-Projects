# Some optional projects for your project(s)
---

### Using the `<form>` project:

- [ ] Try setting it to use .map instead of using .push, and so the original array isn't altered.
- [ ] Add the names as elements on the page that use flex, and include a delete button that removes them from the array.<br>
  - [ ] (optional) Sort them alphabetically this time with .sort
- [ ] build another that stores them in localStorage, and make sure they stay in your browser (non-incognito) when you revisit the page, and make `<div>` cards out of them that allow you to delete the DOM element and remove from `localStorage`
- [ ] try making one that doesn't have a <form> and only uses this for HTML:
```
<div id="whatever"></div>
<button id="whatever">Add Name</button>
```
(then append the names inside of a card in the #whatever div.  Add an edit and a delete button - for that one you could use objects.)
